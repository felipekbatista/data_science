Here is the code I'm using for the cleansing and study of the data and the .csv files that I've managed to produce with the code

I'm coding with colab.

The files:
'exercise_36' is the initial file, the raw material
'exercise_36_v1' preprocessing done in the data, such as column rename and dataset segregation
