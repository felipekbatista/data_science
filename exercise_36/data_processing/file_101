Here is the code I'm using for the cleansing and study of the data and the .csv files that I've managed to produce with the code

I'm coding with colab.

The files:
'exercise_36.csv' is the initial file, the raw material
'exercise_36_v1.csv' preprocessing done in the data, such as column rename and dataset segregation
'exercise_36_functions' this is where I write and test the functions I will be using for making easy handling that ammount of data.
  so far, there are 2 kinds: graphs and outliers remover (use the interquartile as threshold)
'exercise_36_v1.ipynb' code after the use of cleansing functions on set_1
